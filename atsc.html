			<h3> Alray Taylor Second Chance </h3>
			</br>
			<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 170, 247)">Description:</span> One of the organizations central themes is that while urban students can often reach great heights, thanks to their own talents and the support of dedicated people around them, they are usually afforded far fewer second chances when things don’t go as planned. That’s why the Alray Scholars Program encompasses more than just financial assistance. Scholarship recipients are teamed with dedicated mentors who offer guidance and support, with the goal of helping students avoid past missteps and expand their horizons. </p>
