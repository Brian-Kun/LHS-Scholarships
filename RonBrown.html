			<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 170, 247)">Description:</span> The Ron Brown Scholar Fund is a 501(c)3 public charity, managed by an independent Board of Trustees.  The Program  which was named for the late Secretary of Commerce and inspired by his dedication to public service, focuses on encouraging civic engagement among Scholars while promoting academic excellence, community and lifelong interactions.  Recipients are young African Americans of outstanding promise who are offered academic scholarships, service opportunities and leadership experiences. The Ron Brown Scholar Program also provides Scholars with the financial resources to attend some of the finest colleges and universities in the country. Upon acceptance, Scholars are each awarded $40,000 ($10,000 per year for 4 years toward educational expenses), that may be used at the college or university of their choice. Acceptance into the Program means Scholars are also provided with the nurturing and mentorship to succeed and flourish in college and beyond.  The Ron Brown Scholar Program has a proven track record of academic success with a 99 percent graduation rate. Graduating Scholars go on to outstanding careers in technology, arts, sciences and public service, and many more pursue professional degrees in law, medicine and business.
